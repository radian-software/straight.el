;;; install.el --- Install straight.el from scratch -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Caution: this file contains copious amounts of magic. You have been
;; warned.

;; For the sake of sanity, here is the issue. We want to install
;; straight.el, but to do that we need to figure out what repository
;; to install it from. That requires parsing the recipe that the user
;; has provided, if any. But not only is that logic a part of
;; straight.el itself, but the logic changes depending on the version
;; of straight.el. It would seem to be impossible to get straight.el
;; to correctly install any version of itself, without hardcoding the
;; repository. Not so!
;;
;; We start out by making sure that a recipe version identifier is
;; saved in the version lockfiles whenever they are saved. We put the
;; version identifier in the lockfiles because if the lockfiles are
;; absent, then we are just installing the latest version of
;; straight.el anyway, so there is no need for the version identifier
;; in that case.
;;
;; Then we look for lockfiles, and determine the version identifier.
;; This is automatically translated into a branch name for
;; straight.el. The idea is that while there are lots of revisions of
;; straight.el, only a few actually change the interpretation of
;; recipe fetch keywords. And so we can actually use a rather
;; coarse-grained selection of revisions to get all the versions of
;; straight.el that we need in order to parse any given recipe format.
;;
;; After we get the appropriate branch name, we directly download that
;; branch's revision of straight.el (the file) from the official
;; GitHub repository, raxod502/straight.el. Now, one of the goals of
;; this implementation is that forking straight.el does not require
;; any changes to this file as long as you do not make divergent
;; changes to the interpretation of recipe fetch keywords. The fact
;; that we download from the source rather than whatever fork is
;; specified does not actually violate this goal, if you think about
;; it. If the fork *does* make divergent changes to recipe
;; interpretation, then all it needs to do is update the version
;; identifier in `straight-freeze-versions', tag a new branch with a
;; unique version identifier, and override the hardcoded
;; raxod502/straight.el to the fork (this last part being necessary
;; because otherwise the new branch could not be found; all previous
;; branches would still be available, though).
;;
;; After we get a copy of straight.el, it's just a matter of using it
;; to parse the recipe for straight.el itself, taking into account all
;; user-set variables. But of course evaluating straight.el will mess
;; up the environment, so we have to do this in a child Emacs
;; instance.
;;
;; Previous versions of straight.el expected a symlink for
;; bootstrap.el, in order for the bootstrap snippet to be able to
;; identify the name of the local repository for straight.el. I
;; decided later that this was more trouble than it was worth, and
;; that users wishing to rename the repository can reasonably be
;; expected to update their bootstrap snippet. We still create the
;; symlink, though, for backwards compatibility (this script should
;; work for all versions of straight.el, present and past).
;;
;; IMPORTANT: When referring to newly introduced variables in
;; straight.el, *always* use `bound-and-true-p' so as to avoid
;; regressions with old versions of straight.el that did not define
;; those variables; see
;; <https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/issues/407>.

;; We have to wrap everything in a single form so that this file can
;; be evaluated with `eval-print-last-sexp', rather than
;; `eval-buffer', since the latter forcibly swallows all errors(!) and
;; turns them into warnings.
