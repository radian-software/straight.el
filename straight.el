;; Keywords: extensions
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4"))
;; Version: 1.0

;;; Commentary:

;; straight.el is a next-generation package manager for Emacs. It
;; clones packages into your ~/.emacs.d and handles byte-compilation,
;; autoload generation, and load path management. Dependency
;; management, powerful tools for managing your packages in bulk, and
;; out-of-the-box compatibility with MELPA and EmacsMirror are also
;; included.

;; straight.el improves on other package managers in several ways.
;; Most importantly, it offers first-class support for easily
;; modifying packages and contributing your changes upstream. It also
;; supports complete reproducibility for your configuration by writing
;; a lockfile with the versions of all your packages. Alternatively,
;; straight.el will work with manually managed packages, if you prefer
;; to merge in packages as subtrees.

;; Please see https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el for more
;; information.

  ;;    lines of code. (Note, though, that there is still a conflict
  ;;    if you load the second package before its custom-recipe
  ;;    dependency, as should be expected.)

  ;;    package. For example, this comes up when you need to load both
  ;;    `tex-site' and `tex' from your fork of `auctex'. It's
  ;;    inconvenient to specify your custom recipe in both
  ;;    `use-package' declarations, but with the following two lines
  ;;    of code, you can specify your custom recipe in the first
  ;;    `use-package' declaration and then specify only `auctex' as
  ;;    the recipe in the second `use-package' declaration.
  ;;
  ;; 3. I'm using `straight-rebuild-package' or

  "Expand FILES directive mapping from SRC-DIR to DEST-DIR.
SRC-DIR and DEST-DIR are absolute paths; the intention is that
symlinks are created in DEST-DIR pointing to SRC-DIR (but this
function does not do that). Return a list of cons cells
representing the mappings from SRC-DIR to DEST-DIR. The paths in
the cons cells are absolute.

FILES is a list, or nil. Each element of FILES can be a string, a
cons cell, a list, or the symbol `:defaults'.

If an entry is a string, then it is expanded into a (possibly
empty) list of extant files in SRC-DIR using
`file-expand-wildcards'. Each of these files corresponds to a
link from the file in SRC-DIR to a file with the same name (sans
directory) in DEST-DIR.

If an entry is a cons cell, then it is taken as a literal mapping
from a file in SRC-DIR to a file in DEST-DIR (the directory is
not removed). In this case, wildcard expansion does not take
place.

If an entry is a list, then it must begin with either a string or
the symbol `:exclude'.

If the list begins with a string, then the remainder of the list
is expanded as a top-level FILES directive, except that all
target paths have the first element of the list prepended to
then. In other words, this form specifies further links to be
placed within a particular subdirectory of DEST-DIR.

If the list begins with the symbol `:exclude', then the remainder
of the list is expanded as a top-level FILES directive, except
that all previously defined links pointing to any files in the
resulting list are removed. Note that this means any links
specified previously in the current list are subject to removal,
and also any links specified previously at any higher-level list,
but not any links specified afterwards in the current list, or
any higher-level list. Note also that `:exclude' can be nested:
in this case the inner `:exclude' results in some files being
excluded from the outer `:exclude', meaning that they will not
actually be excluded.

If the entry is the symbol `:defaults', then the value of
`straight-default-files-directive' is spliced into the enclosing
list to replace `:defaults'.

If FILES is nil, it defaults to
`straight-default-files-directive'.

If two links are specified that take the same source path to
different target paths, the one that is specified textually later
in FILES will win.

Note that this specification is quite similar to the one used by
the MELPA recipe repository, with some minor differences:

* MELPA recipes do not support cons cells to rename files or
  specify explicit subdirectories

* MELPA recipes do not support putting `:defaults' anywhere
  except as the first element of the top-level list

* When using `:exclude' in a MELPA recipe, the current DEST-DIR
  prefix created by enclosing lists is not respected.

* Whenever a *.el.in file is linked in a MELPA recipe, the target
  of the link is named as *.el.

* When using `:exclude' in a MELPA recipe, only links defined in
  the current list are subject to removal, and not links defined
  in higher-level lists."

This is the main entry point to the functionality of straight.el.

MELPA-STYLE-RECIPE is either a symbol naming a package, or a list
whose car is a symbol naming a package and whose cdr is a
property list containing e.g. `:type', `:local-repo', `:files',
and VC backend specific keywords.

First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If
NO-CLONE is a function, then it is called with two arguments: the
package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If
NO-BUILD is a function, then it is called with one argument: the
package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a non-nil `:no-build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

CAUSE is a string explaining the reason why
`straight-use-package' has been called. It is for internal use
only, and is used to construct progress messages. INTERACTIVE is
non-nil if the function has been called interactively. It is for
internal use only, and is used to determine whether to show a
hint about how to install the package permanently.

Return non-nil if package was actually installed, and nil
otherwise (this can only happen if NO-CLONE is non-nil)."
