;;; Commentary:

;; straight.el is a next-generation package manager for Emacs. It
;; clones packages into your ~/.emacs.d and handles byte-compilation,
;; autoload generation, and load path management. Dependency
;; management, powerful tools for managing your packages in bulk, and
;; out-of-the-box compatibility with MELPA, GNU ELPA, and Emacsmirror
;; are also included.

;; straight.el improves on other package managers in several ways.
;; Most importantly, it offers first-class support for easily
;; modifying packages and contributing your changes upstream. It also
;; supports complete reproducibility for your configuration by writing
;; a lockfile with the versions of all your packages. Alternatively,
;; straight.el will work with manually managed packages, if you prefer
;; to merge in packages as subtrees.

;; Please see https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el for more
;; information.

only override the recipe components you are interested in,
instead of being required to override them all. The supported
components are the ones listed by `straight-vc-git-keywords' and
`:files'. Note that enabling this feature has the side effect
that all recipe repos (i.e. melpa, elpa) will always be cloned,
even if you explicitly specify all your recipes.

The `:fork' keyword is handled specially. If its value is a
string instead of a list, then it is assigned as the `:repo' of
the fork. Also the fork recipe will inherit its `:host' component
from the default recipe.

For example, the following are all equivalent with recipe
inheritance enabled.

\\='(package :host \\='gitlab :repo \"other-user/repo\"
          :fork (:host \\='gitlab :repo \"my-user/repo\"))

\\='(package :fork (:host \\='gitlab :repo \"my-user/repo\"))

instead generates an error. The build cache will not be written
back to disk, nor will the filesystem watcher be started (if
enabled).

As one example of a use case for safe mode, suppose you want to
byte-compile your Emacs configuration asynchronously in the
background. To avoid multiple Emacs processes modifying the
filesystem concurrently via straight.el, you might want to enable
safe mode for the background Emacs process.

Safe mode is not guaranteed to be as performant as normal

  ;;    already provided. This problem is solved by the following two

  ;;    if you load the second package before its custom-recipe
  ;;    dependency, as should be expected.)

  ;;    package. For example, this comes up when you need to load both
  ;;    `tex-site' and `tex' from your fork of `auctex'. It's
  ;;    inconvenient to specify your custom recipe in both
  ;;    `use-package' declarations, but with the following two lines
  ;;    of code, you can specify your custom recipe in the first
  ;;    `use-package' declaration and then specify only `auctex' as
  ;;    the recipe in the second `use-package' declaration.
  ;;
  ;; 3. I'm using `straight-rebuild-package' or

This is a list of symbols. If `find-at-startup' is in the list,
then find(1) is used to detect modifications of all packages
before they are made available. If `find-when-checking' is in the
list, then find(1) is used to detect modifications in
\\[straight-check-package] and \\[straight-check-all]. If
`check-on-save' is in the list, then `before-save-hook' is used
to detect modifications of packages that you perform within
Emacs. If `watch-files' is in the list, then a filesystem watcher
is automatically started by straight.el to detect modifications.

Note that the functionality of `check-on-save' and `watch-files'
only covers modifications made within ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos,
so if you wish to use these features you should move all of your
local repositories into that directory.

PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS: `at-startup' means straight.el will run
a command during startup, which can be fairly slow, especially if
you do not have an SSD. Disable this to improve startup time.
However, you will still want to have package modifications
detected. Therefore add either `check-on-save', which has no
overhead but also does not catch modifications made outside of
Emacs, or `watch-files', which is more robust but has an external
dependency (watchexec) and takes up memory / file descriptors.

For backwards compatibility, the value of this variable may also
be a symbol, which is translated into a corresponding list as
follows:

`at-startup' => `(find-at-startup find-when-checking)'
`live' => `(check-on-save)'
`live-with-find' => `(check-on-save find-when-checking)'
`never' => nil

  "Expand FILES directive mapping from SRC-DIR to DEST-DIR.
SRC-DIR and DEST-DIR are absolute paths; the intention is that
symlinks are created in DEST-DIR pointing to SRC-DIR (but this
function does not do that). Return a list of cons cells
representing the mappings from SRC-DIR to DEST-DIR. The paths in
the cons cells are absolute.

FILES is a list, or nil. Each element of FILES can be a string, a
cons cell, a list, or the symbol `:defaults'.

If an entry is a string, then it is expanded into a (possibly
empty) list of extant files in SRC-DIR using
`file-expand-wildcards'. Each of these files corresponds to a
link from the file in SRC-DIR to a file with the same name (sans
directory) in DEST-DIR.

If an entry is a cons cell, then it is taken as a literal mapping
from a file in SRC-DIR to a file in DEST-DIR (the directory is
not removed). In this case, wildcard expansion does not take
place.

If an entry is a list, then it must begin with either a string or
the symbol `:exclude'.

If the list begins with a string, then the remainder of the list
is expanded as a top-level FILES directive, except that all
target paths have the first element of the list prepended to
then. In other words, this form specifies further links to be
placed within a particular subdirectory of DEST-DIR.

If the list begins with the symbol `:exclude', then the remainder
of the list is expanded as a top-level FILES directive, except
that all previously defined links pointing to any files in the
resulting list are removed. Note that this means any links
specified previously in the current list are subject to removal,
and also any links specified previously at any higher-level list,
but not any links specified afterwards in the current list, or
any higher-level list. Note also that `:exclude' can be nested:
in this case the inner `:exclude' results in some files being
excluded from the outer `:exclude', meaning that they will not
actually be excluded.

If the entry is the symbol `:defaults', then the value of
`straight-default-files-directive' is spliced into the enclosing
list to replace `:defaults'.

If FILES is nil, it defaults to
`straight-default-files-directive'.

If two links are specified that take the same source path to
different target paths, the one that is specified textually later
in FILES will win.

Note that this specification is quite similar to the one used by
the MELPA recipe repository, with some minor differences:

* MELPA recipes do not support cons cells to rename files or
  specify explicit subdirectories

* MELPA recipes do not support putting `:defaults' anywhere
  except as the first element of the top-level list

* When using `:exclude' in a MELPA recipe, the current DEST-DIR
  prefix created by enclosing lists is not respected.

* Whenever a *.el.in file is linked in a MELPA recipe, the target
  of the link is named as *.el.

* When using `:exclude' in a MELPA recipe, only links defined in
  the current list are subject to removal, and not links defined
  in higher-level lists.

If FLAVOR is nil or omitted, then expansion takes place as
described above. If FLAVOR is the symbol `melpa', then *.el.in
files will be linked as *.el files as in MELPA. If FLAVOR is any
other value, the behavior is not specified."

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If

  - :post-bootstrap (Form)...
      Forms evaluated in the testing environment after boostrapping.
      e.g. (straight-use-package '(example :type git :host github))

  - :interactive Boolean
      If nil, the subprocess will immediately exit after the test.
      Output will be printed to `straight-bug-report--process-buffer'
      Otherwise, the subprocess will be interactive.

  - :preserve Boolean
      If non-nil, the test directory is left in the directory stored in the
      variable `temporary-file-directory'. Otherwise, it is
      immediately removed after the test is run.

  - :executable String
      Indicate the Emacs executable to launch.
      Defaults to the path of the current Emacs executable.

  - :raw Boolean
      If non-nil, the raw process output is sent to
      `straight-bug-report--process-buffer'. Otherwise, it is
      formatted as markdown for submitting as an issue.

  - :user-dir String
      If non-nil, the test is run with `user-emacs-directory' set to STRING.
      Otherwise, a temporary directory is created and used.
      Unless absolute, paths are expanded relative to the variable
