## What's wrong



## Directions to reproduce

<!--
Please give instructions for how to reproduce the behavior _starting from an empty `~/.emacs.d`_. Unfortunately, I simply don't have enough time to check out your bug report unless it has clear instructions for this.

straight.el provides a macro, `straight-bug-report`, which can be used to easily create a minimal reproduction case in a clean Emacs environment. Please use this if possible. For instructions, see <https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el#debugging> and the `straight-bug-report` docstring.

If `straight-bug-report` is not available or fails you can still create a reproduction case manually. To do this, start with an empty `~/.emacs.d/init.el`, add the bootstrap snippet, and then add any additional code from your init-file that's needed to set up the buggy behavior. Then include a list of steps to follow (commands to run, files to modify, whatever) after Emacs startup.

Make sure you're using the latest version of straight.el. You can do this by including (setq straight-repository-branch "develop") in your init-file before the bootstrap snippet.

Also, unless you are already quite certain that your problem is specific to straight.el, please verify that it cannot be reproduced using package.el. If you can reproduce your problem with package.el, then it's not a bug in straight.el and I can't do anything about it!

If you try these steps and can't reproduce the problem, it must be something particular to your environment or configuration. In this case, you'll have to bisect in order to figure out what is causing the problem. I won't be able to debug a problem that only happens on your computer!
